## Nearest Neighbour Algorithms, Trees, and Forests

* _What we mean with non-parametric / instance-based machine learning algorithms?_🧠
  * Non-parametric ML algorithms are algorithms, that do not learn a parametric model, but store all the training data and use the training data to make predictions.
  * Examples include the $$k$$-nearest neighbour algorithm and the Gaussian processes.
* _How does_ $$k$$_-Nearest neighbour works?🧠_
  * To classifiy a new input vector $$x$$, we examine the $$k$$closest training data points to $$x$$\(that lie within a hypersphere\). 
  * We assign the class that is most frequent among those neighbours to the query point $$x$$.
* _Why is it hard to use for high-dimensional data?🧠_
  * $$k$$-Nearest neighbour is built around a distant-based measure. However, in a very high-dimensional space, most points are equally far appart from each other.
  * So the neighbourhood becomes large.
* _How to search for nearest neighbours efficiently?🧠_
  * It's convient to use a KD-tree as the data structure. The KD tree is balanced and performs binary splits on the feature space.
  * Searching goes like this:
    * Find region containing $$\boldsymbol{x}$$. Navigate starting from the root node to the child node containing $$\boldsymbol{x}$$.
    * Save region point $$\boldsymbol{x}^{*} = \boldsymbol{x}_{0}$$ as current best.
    * Move up tree and recursively search regions interesecting hypersphere $$S\left(\boldsymbol{x},\left\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}^{*}\right\|\right)$$. 
    * Update $$\boldsymbol{x}^{*}$$ if new nearsest neighbour has been found.
* _What is a binary regression / decision tree?🧠_
  * A binary decision tree is a tree that performs a binary split at each node. The predictor space is segmented into smaller regions. 
  * In case of regression trees the predicted value at a node is the average response variable of all observations within this node.
* _What are useful splitting criterions?🧠_
  * **For regression trees:** 
    * Minimum residual sum of squares: $$\mathrm{RSS}=\sum_{\text {left }}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{L}\right)^{2}+\sum_{\text {right }}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{R}\right)^{2}$$ 
  * **For classification trees:**
    * Information gain / Minimum entropy: $$N_{L} H\left(p_{\mathrm{L}}\right)+N_{R} H\left(p_{\mathrm{R}}\right)$$ 
* _How can we influence the model complexity of a tree?_🧠
  * One can limit the depth of the tree or limit the minimum number of samples that must be present within one node.
  * Another way is to apply pruning to a decision tree, which refers to cutting back a fully grown tree.
* _Why is it useful to use multiple trees and randomization?_🧠
  * Decision Trees are prone to overfitting. That's why we should learn several trees to increase variability.
  * By randomizing the features and combining the trees \(random forest\) or learning several trees on bootstrap samples \(bagging\) one can prevent trees from overfitting.
* Name at least two advantages and two disadvantages of decision trees. 🦧
  * **Advantages**:
    * Easy to interpret \(if they are small\)
    * Computionally efficient. They are quick to fit, even for large problems.
  * **Disadvantage**:
    * Other ML methods such as NN achieve a better accuracy.
    * Suffer from instability, if we change the data, ever-so-slightly trees can change a lot. 
* _Which data structure is usually used to efficiently implement k-Nearest Neighbours? Name the main steps in building that data structure._🦧
  * KD-Trees are commonly used.
  * Building the tree:
    * choose dimension \(e. g. longest hyper-rectangle\)
    * Choose median as pivot
    * Split node according tho chosen pivot and dimension.

## Clustering

* _How is the clustering problem defined?🧠_
  * Clustering tries to find a natural grouping within the data.
  * One tries to maximize the intra-cluster similarity and minimize the inter-cluster similarity.
* _Why is it called 'unsupervised'?🧠_
  * It's called unsupervised, as the data is unlabeled. There is no supervisor, that tells us in advance to which cluster a training data point belongs. Hence, unsupervised. The structure is actually learned from the data. 
* _How do hierarchical clustering methods work?_ 🧠
  * **Init-phase:** Each of the $$n$$samples becomes a cluster itself
  * **Iterate-phase:** 
    1. Find closest clusters and merge them
    2. Proceed until we have a single cluster
* _What is the rule of the cluster-2-cluster distance and which distances can we use?_🧠
  * So called cluster linkage types define the distance between two clusters. Commonly used are
    * Single linkage
    * Complete linkage
    * Average linkage
    * Centroid linkage
* _How does the_ $$k$$_-mean algorithm work? What are the two main steps?_🧠
  * The two main steps are the **assigment** and **adjustment step**.
  * **Assignment step:** 
    * Assign each sample to its closest centroid $$z_{n}=\arg \min_{k}\left\|\boldsymbol{c}_{k}-\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\right\|^{2}$$ 
  * **Adjustment Step:**
    * Adjust the centroids to be the means of the samples assigned to them: $$c_{k}=\frac{1}{\left|X_{k}\right|} \sum_{\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \in X_{k}} \boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \quad X_{k}=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{n} \mid z_{n}=k\right\}$$ 
* _Why does the algorithm converge? What is it minimizing?_🧠
  * $$k$$-means minimizes the Sum of Squared Distances \(SSD\). By checking, if a cluster centeroids exists, that is closer to a point than its current cluster centroid the SSD is reduced. If no closer custer centre exists and the SSD remains constant.
  * SSD is defined as $$\operatorname{SSD}(C ; \mathcal{D})=\sum_{i=1}^{n} d\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, c\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)\right)^{2} $$ 
* _Does_ $$k$$_-means find a global minimum of the objective?🧠_
  * No, generally it doesn't. Finding a global minimum is a NP-hard problem. One would have to check all assignments to find the global best solution.
  * More over, the result of $$k$$-means is heavily dependent on the initialisation.
