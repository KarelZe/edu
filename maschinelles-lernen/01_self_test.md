## Linear Regression

* Under which assumptions is the least squares objective from linear regression equivalent to a maximum likelihood objective?ü¶ß
  * Gaussian likelihood with linear mean and constant noise.
* Give the formula for ridge regression and explain its components.
* Give the formula for LASSO and explain its components.
* Compare Multiple Linear Regression to LASSO. Why is it desirable to penalize a Linear Regression model?
* Why do errors of a linear regression model have to be normally distributed?

## Linear Classification\*

* Write down the objective of linear binary logistic regression. The samples are given by $$x_{i}$$ and the labels by $$c_{i} \in\{0,1\}$$. How is $$p\left(c_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)$$ assumed to be distributed in binary logistic regression?ü¶ß
  * $$\operatorname{argmax}_{\boldsymbol{w}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_{i} \log \left(\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)\right)+\left(1-c_{i}\right) \log \left(1-\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{w}^{T} \boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)\right)$$ 
  * Logistic regression assumes $$p\left(c_{i} \mid x_{i}\right)$$to be Bernoulli distributed.

## Model Selection\*

* _Why is it a bad idea to evaluate your algorithm on the training set? üß†_
  * It's important to use unseen data when evaluating an algorithm to prevent overfitting. 
  * One would have zero empirical risk but a very high true risk.
  * In the worst case an algorithm could learn the data by heart, perform well during testing and training but perform poorly on real unseen data.
* _What is the difference between true and empirical risk? üß†_
  * **True risk** is the performance on a random testpoint $$(x,y)$$. True risk is unknown.
  * **Empirical risk** is the performance on the training set. Empirical risk can evaluated using training samples.
* _The true risk can be decomposed in which parts?üß†_
  * The true risk can be decomposed into:

    $$\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{D_{n}}\left[\mathbb{E}_{x, y}\left[\left(\hat{f}_{D_{n}}(x)-\hat{f}_{*}(x)\right)^{2}\right]\right]}_{\text {Variance }}+\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{x, y}\left[\left(\hat{f}_{*}(x)-f(x)\right)^{2}\right]}_{\text {Bias }^{2}}+\underbrace{\sigma^{2}}_{\text {noise }}$$ 
* _How is the bias and the variance of a learning algorithm defined and how do they contribute to the true risk?_üß†
  * **Variance**:
    * $$\mathbb{E}_{D_{n}}\left[\mathbb{E}_{x, y}\left[\left(\hat{f}_{D_{n}}(\boldsymbol{x})-\hat{f}_{*}(\boldsymbol{x})\right)^{2}\right]\right]$$ 
    * Variance is the difference between the estimates and the "best" estimates. Error depends on the number of data points that are available for training. It accounts for the limitations in the training data set.
  * **Bias**:
    * $$\mathbb{E}_{x, y}\left[\left(\hat{f}_{*}(\boldsymbol{x})-f(\boldsymbol{x})\right)^{2}\right]$$ 
    * Bias is the difference between the true function and the "best" estimate of the model. 
  * Bias, variance and noise sum up to the true risk.
* _What is the advantage/disadvantage of k-fold CV vs. the Hold-out method?üß†_
  * k-Fold CV uses the entire data set for training, as the $$k$$-th fold is used for testing and the remaining folds are used for training. This is less wasteful compared to the Hold-Out-method, where a certain percentage of the data is exclusively reserved for testing.
  * On the other hand, is k-Fold CV more computationally expensive as it requires $$k$$ iterations to train the model. It also leads to more stable results though. In comparsion the Hold-out-method is less computationally expensive, as it requires only one run. 
  * What is problematic about the hold-out method is, that unlucky splits might give misleading results.
* _Why does it make sense to penalize the norm of the weight vector?üß†_
  * Applying a penalty to large weight vectors helps to keep the parameters small. Which leads to a smoother function. 
  * Also, the complexity of the model is limited.
  * The larger $$\lambda$$, the less complex the final model will be.
* _Which norm can we use and what are the different effects?_

  * $$\ell_1$$ **penalty**: 
    * $$\operatorname{penalty}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\|\boldsymbol{\theta}\|_{1}=\sum_{d}\left|\theta_{d}\right|$$ 
    * Introduces sparse solutions, that means some parameters can be 0. Suitable for feature selection.
    * Hard to optimize.
  * $$\ell_2$$ **penalty**:
    * $$\operatorname{penalty}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\|\boldsymbol{\theta}\|_{2}=\sum_{d} \theta_{d}^{2}$$ 
    * Redundant parameters will be close to 0, but never 0.
    * Easy to optimize.

* _What is the effect of early stopping?_üß†
  * Early stopping prevents overfitting, as model is not trained to to the smallest training error. 
  * Further more, the model's complexity is limited. E. g. with Boosting approaches, one doesn't learn overly complicated trees.

## Nearest Neighbour Algorithms, Trees, and Forests\*

* _What we mean with non-parametric / instance-based machine learning algorithms?_üß†
  * Non-parametric ML algorithms are algorithms, that do not learn a parametric model, but store all the training data and use the training data to make predictions.
  * Examples include the $$k$$-nearest neighbour algorithm and the Gaussian processes.
* _How does_ $$k$$_-Nearest neighbour works?üß†_
  * To classifiy a new input vector $$x$$, we examine the $$k$$closest training data points to $$x$$\(that lie within a hypersphere\). 
  * We assign the class that is most frequent among those neighbours to the query point $$x$$.
* _Why is it hard to use for high-dimensional data?üß†_
  * $$k$$-Nearest neighbour is built around a distant-based measure. However, in a very high-dimensional space, most points are equally far appart from each other.
  * So the neighbourhood becomes large.
* _How to search for nearest neighbours efficiently?üß†_
  * It's convient to use a KD-tree as the data structure. The KD tree is balanced and performs binary splits on the feature space.
  * Searching goes like this:
    * Find region containing $$\boldsymbol{x}$$. Navigate starting from the root node to the child node containing $$\boldsymbol{x}$$.
    * Save region point $$\boldsymbol{x}^{*} = \boldsymbol{x}_{0}$$ as current best.
    * Move up tree and recursively search regions interesecting hypersphere $$S\left(\boldsymbol{x},\left\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}^{*}\right\|\right)$$. 
    * Update $$\boldsymbol{x}^{*}$$ if new nearsest neighbour has been found.
* _What is a binary regression / decision tree?üß†_
  * A binary decision tree is a tree that performs a binary split at each node. The predictor space is segmented into smaller regions. 
  * In case of regression trees the predicted value at a node is the average response variable of all observations within this node.
* _What are useful splitting criterions?üß†_
  * **For regression trees:** 
    * Minimum residual sum of squares: $$\mathrm{RSS}=\sum_{\text {left }}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{L}\right)^{2}+\sum_{\text {right }}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}_{R}\right)^{2}$$ 
  * **For classification trees:**
    * Information gain / Minimum entropy: $$N_{L} H\left(p_{\mathrm{L}}\right)+N_{R} H\left(p_{\mathrm{R}}\right)$$ 
* _How can we influence the model complexity of a tree?_üß†
  * One can limit the depth of the tree or limit the minimum number of samples that must be present within one node.
  * Another way is to apply pruning to a decision tree, which refers to cutting back a fully grown tree.
* _Why is it useful to use multiple trees and randomization?_üß†
  * Decision Trees are prone to overfitting. That's why we should learn several trees to increase variability.
  * By randomizing the features and combining the trees \(random forest\) or learning several trees on bootstrap samples \(bagging\) one can prevent trees from overfitting.
* Name at least two advantages and two disadvantages of decision trees. ü¶ß
  * **Advantages**:
    * Easy to interpret \(if they are small\)
    * Computionally efficient. They are quick to fit, even for large problems.
  * **Disadvantage**:
    * Other ML methods such as NN achieve a better accuracy.
    * Suffer from instability, if we change the data, ever-so-slightly trees can change a lot. 
* _Which data structure is usually used to efficiently implement k-Nearest Neighbours? Name the main steps in building that data structure._ü¶ß
  * KD-Trees are commonly used.
  * Building the tree:
    * choose dimension \(e. g. longest hyper-rectangle\)
    * Choose median as pivot
    * Split node according tho chosen pivot and dimension.

## Clustering\*

* _How is the clustering problem defined?üß†_
  * Clustering tries to find a natural grouping within the data.
  * One tries to maximize the intra-cluster similarity and minimize the inter-cluster similarity.
* _Why is it called 'unsupervised'?üß†_
  * It's called unsupervised, as the data is unlabeled. There is no supervisor, that tells us in advance to which cluster a training data point belongs. Hence, unsupervised. The structure is actually learned from the data. 
* _How do hierarchical clustering methods work?_ üß†
  * **Init-phase:** Each of the $$n$$samples becomes a cluster itself
  * **Iterate-phase:** 
    1. Find closest clusters and merge them
    2. Proceed until we have a single cluster
* _What is the rule of the cluster-2-cluster distance and which distances can we use?_üß†
  * So called cluster linkage types define the distance between two clusters. Commonly used are
    * Single linkage
    * Complete linkage
    * Average linkage
    * Centroid linkage
* _How does the_ $$k$$_-mean algorithm work? What are the two main steps?_üß†
  * The two main steps are the **assigment** and **adjustment step**.
  * **Assignment step:** 
    * Assign each sample to its closest centroid $$z_{n}=\arg \min_{k}\left\|\boldsymbol{c}_{k}-\boldsymbol{x}_{n}\right\|^{2}$$ 
  * **Adjustment Step:**
    * Adjust the centroids to be the means of the samples assigned to them: $$c_{k}=\frac{1}{\left|X_{k}\right|} \sum_{\boldsymbol{x}_{i} \in X_{k}} \boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \quad X_{k}=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{n} \mid z_{n}=k\right\}$$ 
* _Why does the algorithm converge? What is it minimizing?_üß†
  * $$k$$-means minimizes the Sum of Squared Distances \(SSD\). By checking, if a cluster centeroids exists, that is closer to a point than its current cluster centroid the SSD is reduced. If no closer custer centre exists and the SSD remains constant.
  * SSD is defined as $$\operatorname{SSD}(C ; \mathcal{D})=\sum_{i=1}^{n} d\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, c\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)\right)^{2} $$ 
* _Does_ $$k$$_-means find a global minimum of the objective?üß†_
  * No, generally it doesn't. Finding a global minimum is a NP-hard problem. One would have to check all assignments to find the global best solution.
  * More over, the result of $$k$$-means is heavily dependent on the initialisation.

## Dimensionality Reduction

* Why does EM always improve the lower bound?üß†
* Why does EM always improve the marginal likelihood?üß†
* Why can we optimize each mixture component independently with EM?üß†
* Why do we need sampling for continuous latent variables?üß†

## Kernel methods\*

* What is the definition of a kernel and its relation to an underlying feature space?üß†
  * Let $$\phi: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}$$ be an arbitrary feature function, then $$k\left(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}^{\prime}\right)=\left\langle\phi(\boldsymbol{x}), \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle$$ defines a positive definite kernel.
* Why are kernels more powerful than traditional feature-based methods?üß†
  * Traditional feature-based methods require working in the higher-dimensional feature space, while kernel-based methods do not.
* What do we mean by the kernel trick?üß†
  * Kernel methods allow to calculate the dot product in a high-dimensional feature space without ever computing the mapping $$\phi$$ of the data in that space. Instead of applying the transformations of $$\phi (x)$$explicitly, the computation is done in the lower-dimensional feature space by replacing the inner product with a function.
* How do we apply the kernel trick to ridge regression?üß†
  * The ridge solution is given by: $$\boldsymbol{w}_{\text {ridge }}^{*}=\underbrace{\left(\Phi^{T} \Phi+\lambda \boldsymbol{I}\right)^{-1}}_{d \times d \text { matrix inversion }} \boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T} \boldsymbol{y}$$ 
  * By applying the "searle set of identies" \( $$(\boldsymbol{I}+\boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{B})^{-1} \boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{A}(\boldsymbol{I}+\boldsymbol{B} \boldsymbol{A})^{-1})$$ we get:
  * $$\boldsymbol{w}^{*}=\underbrace{\left(\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T} \boldsymbol{\Phi}+\lambda \boldsymbol{I}\right)^{-1}}_{d \times d \text { matrix inversion }} \boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T} \boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T} \underbrace{\left(\Phi \Phi^{T}+\lambda \boldsymbol{I}\right)^{-1}}_{N \times N \text { matrix inversion }} \boldsymbol{y}$$
  *  The kernelized version is then given by: $$\boldsymbol{w}^{*}=\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{T} \underbrace{(\boldsymbol{K}+\lambda \boldsymbol{I})^{-1} \boldsymbol{y}}_{\alpha}=\mathbf{\Phi}^{T} \boldsymbol{\alpha}$$ 
* Study the kernel properties, where is symmetry relevant? Where and why is positive definiteness of matrix important?
  * Inner products are symmetric and strictly positive definite. \(see [here.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-097-prediction-machine-learning-and-statistics-spring-2012/lecture-notes/MIT15_097S12_lec13.pdf)\) Thus, a function substituting the product aka kernel has to fullfill the same properties.
* What is the impact of changing $$\sigma$$ in a RBF kernel?
  * Recall the RBF kernel is given by $$k(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y})=\exp \left(-\frac{\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}\|^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}\right)$$.
  * If the distance between $$\boldsymbol{x}- \boldsymbol{y}$$is large, $$\exp$$will be small, this means training observations $$\boldsymbol{x}$$will hardly play any role in the prediction of  test observation $$\boldsymbol{y}$$.
  * The $$\sigma$$now controls the width of the neighbourhood or the variance of the Gaussian density.
* What is the actual gain from using polynomial kernels?
  * By using a polynomial kernel with $$d>1$$one gets a more flexible decision boundary. This is comparable to fitting e. g. a classifier in a higher dimensional feature space.
* What is the purpose of the kernel matrix?
  * A kernel matrix is built by evaluating the kernel on all pairs and any set inputs. So it stores the similarities of all samples.
  * $$[\boldsymbol{K}]_{i j}=\boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\right)^{T} \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{j}\right)=k\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{x}_{j}\right)$$
* Proof that the a positive definite Kernel is symmetric.
  * $$k\left(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}^{\prime}\right)=\left\langle\boldsymbol{\phi}(\boldsymbol{x}), \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle = \left\langle\boldsymbol{\phi}(\boldsymbol{x}^{\prime}), \boldsymbol{\phi}\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right)\right\rangle = k\left(\boldsymbol{x}^{\prime}, \boldsymbol{x}\right)$$

## CNNs\*

* Why are fully connected networks for images a bad idea and why do we need images?üß†
  * Spatial structure of image is not preserved, as image must be flattened to an array to be used as an input. However, we want to keep neighbouring pixels together, as they are more correlated.
  *  Training a fully-connected network with large number of inputs requires many parameters / weights. 
  * **Example:** A fully-connected layer with a thousand hidden dimensions and an input image of 1 Megapixel would require one billion parameters. \(Zhang et al. Dive into Deep Learning\)
* What are the key components of a CNN?üß†
  * **Convolutional layer:** A convolutional layer cross-correlates the input and kernel and adds a bias to produce an input. This is used to extract different features.
  * **Pooling layer:** Pooling layer make representations smaller and more managable. They serve the dual purpose of mitigating the **sensitivity** of convolutional layers **to location** and of spartially downsampling representations \(Zhang et al. Dive into Deep Learning\)
  * **Activation function:** After every convolutional operation a non-linear operations e. g. ReLU is applied to replace negative values.
* What hyper-parameters can we set for a convolutional layer and what is their meaning?üß†
  * $$K$$ Number of Filters / Spacial extend
  * $$S$$Stride or step size of slided window
  * $$F$$Kernel size
  * $$P$$Amount of padding added
* What hyper-parameters can we set for a pooling layer and what is their meaning?üß†
  * $$S$$Stride or step size of sliding window
  * $$F$$kernel size / Spacial extend
* How can we compute dimensionality of the output of a convolutional layer?üß†
  * $$W=\left(W-F+2 P\right) / S+1$$ 
  * $$H=\left(H-F+2 P\right) / S+1$$ 
  * $$D=K$$ 
* Describe basic properties of LeNet.
  * LeNet consist of two parts:
    * A convolutional encode consisting of two convolutional layers.
    * A dense block of three fully-connected layers.
  * The convolutional blocks are a convolutional layer, a sigmoid activation function and an average pooling operation. The convolutional layer use a $$5\times5$$kernel and a sigmoid activation function. The pooling operation uses a $$2\times2$$using a stride 2. \(Zhang et al. Dive into Deep Learning\)
* Describe basic properties of 'AlexNet' and 'VCG'.üß†
  * **AlexNet**:
    * AlexNet consists of 8 layers, which means it's deeper than LeNet. The 8 layers consists of five convolutional layers, two fully connected hidden layers and one-fully connected output layer.
    * The convolutional window is of shape $$11 \times 11$$in the first layer and $$5 \times 5$$in the second layer and several $$3 \times 3 $$. 
    * The pooling layers have a window shape of $$3 \times 3$$and a stride of 2.
    * AlexNet used the ReLU activation function.
  * **VCG**:
    * VCG consists of 16-19 layer.
    * Convolutional layers have a window size of $$3 \times 3$$and a stride of 1 and padding of 1.
    * The pooling layers have a window shape of $$2 \times 2$$ and and a stride of 2.
    * VCG used the ReLU activation function.
* What is the main idea of 'ResNet' to make it very deep?üß†
  * ResNet uses 152 layers. 
  * ResNet utilizes so-called residual blocks / residual layers.
* What are **residual layers** in a ResNet model?
  * One can either learn the underlying mapping by learning $$f(\boldsymbol{x})$$or by learning a so-called residual mapping $$f(\boldsymbol{x}) - \boldsymbol{x}$$ and combining it with the identity mapping. The later is easier to learn. 
  * **Example**: If one has to learn the identity function it is as simple as pushing the weights and bias through the layers.
  * As an advantage with residual blocks inputs can forward propagate faster through the residual connections across layers. \(Zhang et al. Dive into Deep Learning\)
* What is the idea of bottleneck layers with **ResNet**?
  * Instead of using two layers for a residual function $$\mathcal{F}$$, they use a 3 layer design consisting of a $$1 \times 1$$, $$3 \times 3 $$ and $$1\times1$$convolution. The $$1\times1$$layers are responsible for reducing and increasing the dimensions, as they preserve the dimension. Where the $$3 \times 3 $$layer acts like a bottleneck. \(see [here.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)\)
* Why is it not feasible to use a fully connected layer for images? How do convolutional neural networks solve this problem and which property of an image do they exploit?ü¶ß
  * They have to many parameters.
  * They have less parameters due to sharing the parameters.
  * They exploit the spatial structure of the image.

## RNNs\*

* How do LSTMs actually avoid the vanishing gradient problem?
  * In order to calculate the hidden state $$h_t$$, RNNs require multiplication with the weight matrix $$\boldsymbol{W}$$multiple times and application of the $$\tanh$$. If Eigenvalues are small, gradients tend to become small as well.
  * The vanishing gradient problem is solved by LSTMs, as the the calculation of the cell state $$c_t$$ requires only a hadamard product with $$f$$, but not matrix multiplication with the weight matrix $$\boldsymbol{W}$$.

## General

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  &\underset{a}{\operatorname{argmax}} a^{2} h \\
  &\qquad \text { s.t. } S_{\max } \geq 2 a^{2}+4 a h
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  Write down the Lagrangian. Derive the optimal value for $$a$$ depending on your lagrangian multiplier. ü¶ß
