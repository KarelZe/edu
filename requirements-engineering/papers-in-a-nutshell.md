| Collaborative Sessions / Brain storming                                                                                          | When dealing with a large autonomous set of stakeholders (1) Needed if interview or observation would just deliver knowledge about the current system (1) Used to develop a preliminary mission statement for the project and target system (2) It promotes freethinking and expression of innovative solutions (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The composition and cohesion within the group is key. (2) Not well suited in highly political situations, as participants cannot speak freely (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Joint Application Development (Investigate problem and possible solutions in a discussion)                                       | Like brainstorming, but main goals of the system are already established (2) Decisions can be made rapidly and issued be resolved quickly. (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Introspection (analyst develops requirements based on what he believes stakeholders want or need)                                | Starting point for other elicitation techniques. Should be used alongside other techniques like interviews (2) Only effective if analyst is familiar with the domain, the goals, and the business processes. (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Questionaires                                                                                                                    | Apply when problem is concrete (1) Market research surveys help to understand external customer needs (1) Provide an efficient way to collect information from multiple stakeholders quickly, but are limited in the depth of knowledge (2) Useful as informal checklists to ensure fundamental elements are addressed early on (2) Questionnaires lack the opportunity to delve further on a topic or expand new ideas. There is no mechanism for participants to clarify or correct misunderstandings (2)                                                                                                      |

Social patterns and complex relationships of stakeholders can be uncovered (2) Observation is very expensive to perform and requires skill from the analyst to grasp the actions being performed (2) Stakeholders might be tempted to adjust their workflow under observation (2)                                                             |

Infrequent / trivial steps might not be explained by the user, as they are taken for granted (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
